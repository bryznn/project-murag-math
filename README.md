**The Space Mission Game**
is an exciting adventure where players navigate a **spaceship to complete missions**
all while secretly applying essential **math skills**.


➡ The primary objective is to **safely land the spaceship on a planet** by carefully **adjusting speed and direction**.

➡ Players must make **strategic decisions about how much fuel to burn and at what angle to approach the planet**,

➡ requiring a solid understanding of numerical relationships.


**Behind the scenes**
➡ The game integrates key **mathematical concepts**:


➡ **fuel management involves subtraction and multiplication,**


➡ **angle adjustments rely on geometry and an understanding of degrees,**


➡ and **speed control incorporates division and estimation.**


By embedding these mathematical principles into an engaging space-themed challenge,
the game **provides a fun and immersive way for players to develop their problem-solving and critical-thinking skills.** 🚀
